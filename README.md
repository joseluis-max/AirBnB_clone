# AirBnB_clone Console

Interpreter to manage my AirBnB_clone objects.

Console, is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This console is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

**We want to be able to manage the objects of our project:**

    - Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
    - Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
    - Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
    - Update attributes of an object
    - Destroy an object

### How to start it ?

1. Clone this repository.
2. Execute console.py file
    ```bash
    $ ./console.py
    ```
3. Introduce command list below

### How to used it ?
    - `create` <class_name> -> return id new class
    - `show` <class_name> <id>
    - `destroy` <class_name> <id>
    - `all`
      `all` <class_name>
    - `update` <class_name> <id> <attribute_name> <new_value>
